<p>Benjamin Doerr is a “professeur de classe exceptionnelle” at the
French Ecole Polytechnique. He received his diploma (1998), PhD (2000)
and habilitation (2005) in mathematics from Kiel University. His
research area is the theory of both problem-specific algorithms and
randomised search heuristics like evolutionary algorithms. Major
contributions to the latter include runtime analyses for existing
evolutionary algorithms, the determination of optimal parameter values,
and complexity theoretic results. Benjamin’s recent
focus is the theory-guided design of novel operators, on-the-fly
parameter choices, and whole new evolutionary algorithms, all hoping
that theory not only explains, but also develops evolutionary computation.</p>
<p>Together with Frank Neumann and Ingo Wegener, Benjamin Doerr founded
the theory track at GECCO and served as its co-chair 2007–2009, 2014,
and 2023–2024. He is an editor of “Artificial Intelligence”,
“Evolutionary Computation”, “IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary
Computation”, “Natural Computing”, “Theoretical Computer Science”
(natural computing series), and three journals on classic algorithms
theory.</p>

<p>John McCall is Director of the National Subsea Centre of Research
Excellence at Robert Gordon University where he is a Professor of
Computing Science. He received a BSC (Hons I) in Mathematics (1986) and
a PhD in Algebraic Topology (1990) from the University of Aberdeen.</p>
<p>His research interests are  in machine learning, search and
optimisation, making novel contributions to a range of nature-inspired
optimisation algorithms including EDA, PSO, ACO and GA and predictive
machine learning methods and deep learning.  Particular contributions to
EDA include Markov network and permutation-based algorithms. Recently he
has become interested in the explainability of evolutionary algorithms
through trajectory analysis. He has 170+ peer-reviewed publications in
books, international journals and conferences. He specialises in
industrially-applied optimization and decision support (Industry 4.0),
working with major international companies including BT, BP, EDF, CNOOC
and Equinor as well as a diverse range of SMEs. Major application areas
for this research are: vehicle logistics, fleet planning and transport
systems modelling; predictive modelling and maintenance in energy
systems; and decision support in industrial operations management. John
is a founding director of Celerum, which specialises in freight
logistics and of PlanSea Solutions, which focuses on marine logistics
planning.</p>
<p>John has served as a member of the IEEE Evolutionary Computing Technical
Committee, an Associate Editor of IEEE Computational Intelligence
Magazine and the IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Journal, and is
currently an Editorial Board member for the journal Complex And
Intelligent Systems. He frequently organises workshops and special
sessions at leading international conferences, including many related to
EDAs. He co-chaired the GECCO EDA track 2013 and 2014,  the GECCO Model
Building EA workshop 2016-17 and the GECCO ECPERM workshop 2019-21.
Currently he is co-editing a Special Issue on Explainability for the
Transactions in Evolutionary Learning and Optimisation (TELO) journal.</p>
