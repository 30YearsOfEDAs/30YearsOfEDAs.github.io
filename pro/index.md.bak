## Call for Abstracts

The purpose of this workshop is to mark the thirty year milestone in a 
mature and diverse topic of continuing interest and to encourage 
thinking on key open questions and future directions. We invite 
participants to contribute short talks aimed at stimulating discussion 
and possible collaboration. Topics may include but are not limited to:

- Novel probabilistic models for EDAs
- What features make a suitable application for EDAs?
- Hybrid probabilistic models for EDAs on mixed variable 
representations
- What mathematical tools will advance theoretical study of EDAs?
- How can theoretical study of EDAs inform the broader EA theory?

We seek participation from researchers and users of EDAs from the population-based metaheuristics community as well as those interested in deepening the theoretical analysis of this algorithm class. We invite participants to submit new ideas, positional statements, and reviews/summaries/comments/techniques on EDAs. 

Accepted abstracts will be asked to provide a 15 minute talk with some questions included. All presentations will be in-person, and submissions are understood to indicate the author's intention to attend in person when submitting.

Submissions are expected to be in the form of short abstracts.
Please send your submissions to zhengweijie@hit.edu.cn (and cc: zhengwj13@foxmail.com) and you will get a confirmation of submission email within two workdays (if not, please forward your submissions to zhengwj13@tsinghua.org.cn).
